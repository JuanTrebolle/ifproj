            - bidder ID

    - Variables:
        * bids (map between bidderID and their bid amount, Private for each bidder's own entry, public for other)

    /*
    Declassifications
        - When a bidder places a live bid that matches a commission bid amount (for example, C bids 700 kr), the bidder's
        identity (bidderID) associated with that bid amount is declassified to public momentarily, revealing only the bidder
        number but not the actual identity.

    /*
      Information Flow Analysis

      - Bidders submit commission bids (including bidderId and maxCommissionBid, both labeled Private).
      - The auction starts with currentHighestBid set to startingPrice (both Public).
      - Live bids are received and compared to currentHighestBid.
      - For live bids matching a commission bid amount, the corresponding bidderId is temporarily declassified to Public (revealing only the bidder number).
      - The winner is determined based on the highest bid (winnerId becomes Public after the auction).
